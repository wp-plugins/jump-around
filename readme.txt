== Description ==

Jump Around allows your visitors to quickly navigate between posts by using the a,s,d,z, and x keys (to effectively "jump" 
to the post in line in the loop).  Or, customize the keys to do what you want them to.

== Installation ==

1. Upload /jump-around/ to your /wp-content/plugins directory.
2. Navigate to your plugins menu in your Wordpress admin.
3. Activate it.
4. You'll find settings for the plugin under Settings->Jump Around.

There are 2 settings.  One is for the container of your posts (usually post), and the other is the container for your 
permalinks (usually entry-title).  Classes ONLY - and do not prefix them with . (incorrect: .post - correct: post).
